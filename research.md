## Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of software engineering, data mining, and empirical methods. I aim to understand and improve software development practices through data-driven approaches. Specific areas include:

### 1. Mining Software Repositories
- Analysis of developer behavior patterns from interaction data
- Code recommendation and program comprehension support
- Empirical studies of software development practices

### 2. Software Security and Vulnerability Analysis
- Automated vulnerability detection and patch localization
- Security patch analysis and risk assessment
- Blockchain smart contract security

### 3. Developer Productivity and Collaboration
- Developer chat analysis and community dynamics
- Code review practices and collaboration patterns
- Remote work impact on software development

### 4. Empirical Software Engineering
- Large-scale studies of open source ecosystems
- Methodological advances in software engineering research
- Replication studies and empirical validation
