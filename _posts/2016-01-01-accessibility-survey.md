We investigated accessibility support of three kinds of commonly used applications on three popular desktop operating systems, including Windows 7, Linux (Ubuntu 14.04) and Mac OS X (10.8.5). Each operating system has an accessibility inspect tool to help us look into software applications, such as inspect on Windows, Accerciser Accessibility Explorer on Ubuntu, and Accessibility Inspector on Mac OS X. The there kinds of applications are: web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer (IE), Safari), IDE (Eclipse, Visual Studio, Xcode, Matlab), and document reader/editor (Office Word, Office Excel), Adobe Reader, Text Editor (Notepad on Windows, gedit on Ubuntu, and TextEdit on Mac OS X)). We examined different UI Components of these applications, including title bar, menu bar, tool bar, context menu, and main content components. Different applications have different UI components. For example, web browser usually has navigation bar, bookmark bar, and web page pane. IDE usually has many views and code editors.

Table I summarizes the results of our investigation. We can see that accessibility support varies greatly across applications and operating systems. For example, Firefox, IE or Safari expose web page content to Windows accessibility API, while Chrome does not (that is, we cannot use Windows accessibility API to extract web page content from Chrome). For an application, the accessibility support can be different across operating systems. For example, Matlab does not expose much accessibility information on Windows, while it exposes accessibility information of all the UI components on Mac OS X. Firefox is the opposite situation. Furthermore, an application can expose some but not all the information. For example, Chrome exposes the information of tab and navigation bar, but not web page content. Finally, a UI component may contain nested UI components. Often, not all the UI components are exposed to accessibility API. For example, we find that when setting breakpoint in Eclipse code editor, the accessibility API can only extract a UI component whose type is “pane”. The vertical ruler of code editor cannot be accessed.
